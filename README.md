# Scholar C# SDK
Scholar CSharp SDK can be used to develop software which integrates Scholar: The Open e-Learning Solution for client software functionality such as searchig for a class (by category, grade and teacher), getting student public information, getting teacher public information, getting information about a class.

As Scholar lets you join classes, write MCQ and essay type questions, read notes, and do assignments the C# SDK can be used to do the same thing using any platform which uses .NET Framework (C#) such as Unity Engine Game Development (although no need to learn while playing a game). 

### SDK Usage
<em>This project is built as a .NET Dynamic Link Library (DLL) which includes all the SDK functions and entities to work with Scholar.</em>

### SDK Functionality
* Get Public Information on Classes, Students and Teachers (incl. Firstname, Lastname, email, qualifications)
* Verify class ownership or attendance
* Verify student / teacher existance
* Searching Class using Class Category, Grade and Teacher
